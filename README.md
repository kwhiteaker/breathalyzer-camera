# breathalyzer-camera


Hi there! This is an upload of my breathalyzer photo booth project, which uses the Texas Instruments MSP430 to measure the user's blood alcohol content from their breath. If the BAC is above a threshold, the device beeps angrily and takes a picture.


INCLUDED FILES:
The C file has to be converted to machine code using the MAKEFILE by entering "make main" into the command line. It runs immediately after upload to the microprocessor.

The PDF explains how the device was made and how it performs, and also the materials needed to build it!
